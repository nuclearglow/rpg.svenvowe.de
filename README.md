My private RPG Markdown Blog (inspired by [this article]())

## Inspirations

- [A SvelteKit markdown blog](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog)
- [Add Lint Staged to SvelteKit](https://davipon.hashnode.dev/add-lint-staged-to-sveltekit-project)
- [Add Commitlint to SvelteKit](https://dev.to/davipon/add-commitint-commitizen-standard-version-and-husky-to-sveltekit-project-14pc)
- powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
